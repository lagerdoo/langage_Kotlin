## History

In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled Project Kotlin, a new language for the JVM, which had been under development for a year.[5] JetBrains lead Dmitry Jemerov said that most languages did not have the features they were looking for, with the exception of Scala. However, he cited the slow compilation time of Scala as a deficiency.[5] One of the stated goals of Kotlin is to compile as quickly as Java. In February 2012, JetBrains open sourced the project under the Apache 2 license.[6]

The name comes from Kotlin Island, near St. Petersburg. Andrey Breslav mentioned that the team decided to name it after an island just like Java was named after the Indonesian island of Java[7] (though the programming language Java was perhaps named after the coffee[8]).

JetBrains hopes that the new language will drive IntelliJ IDEA sales.[9]

Kotlin v1.0 was released on February 15, 2016.[10] This is considered to be the first officially stable release and JetBrains has committed to long-term backwards compatibility starting with this version.

At Google I/O 2017, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android.[3]

Kotlin v1.2 was released on November 28, 2017.[11] Sharing code between JVM and Javascript platforms feature was newly added to this release.

Kotlin v1.3 was released on October 29, 2018, bringing coroutines for asynchronous programming.
